    Anything that you can delegate to somebody without much domain specific knowledge that can be done in 
    <b>
      between an hour
    </b>
     is a good task for us.
    <br />
    We will try to do whatever you need, if we can’t make it you’ll receive a full refund

    <b>
      task is ineligible
    </b>
     by been too complex or it cannot be competed in an hour we will give you a
